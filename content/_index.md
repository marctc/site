Hi, I'm Marc!

I'm a software engineer specialized on distributed systems and observability. I'm based in Berlin and I'm working as Senior Software Engineer in [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com) where I'm part of the [Beyla](https://github.com/grafana/beyla) team, working on automating instrumentation using eBPF. I occasionally contribute to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and I'm a member of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) community.

Besides writing software, I also like to write music: In the past I've recorded some albums with my band [Fura](https://fura.bandcamp.com), and currently I'm learning to play drums. I also love cooking and beer brewing.
