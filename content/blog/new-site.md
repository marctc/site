Hi,

My old site was a little bit abandoned and hard to update so I decided to renew it.

For this time, I decided to use a static site generator so I gave a chance to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I never tried before but I discovered that it has its own [themes site](https://themes.gohugo.io/) which is awesome as saves you a lot of customization time. By the way, if you wonder what template I'm using is the [Cocoa enhanced theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme/).
