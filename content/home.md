Hi, I'm Marc!

I'm a software engineer focused in backend and infrastructure systems. I like distributed systems, software architecture and data engineering. I speak mostly Python and Go.
Proud FSF member for almost a decade, Open Source maintainer and technical conferences attender.

Besides that, I'm a music nerd, audiophile and instrumental rock guitar player ([Fura](http://fura.rocks)). I also love beer and homebrewing.
