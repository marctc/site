I'm not actively doing talks in coferences (for now) but it's an interesting activity.
Here's a list of some talks that I gave in the past:

## 2022

* FOSDEM 2022 (Online): [Periskop: Exception Monitoring at Scale](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/periskop/) [ENG]

## 2017

* PyConES17 (Caceres, Spain): [Modelo de Redes Neuronales Recurrentes para el Análisis y Predicción de Series Temporales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRkHsWhfmHw) [ESP]
