      <description>Django application deployment architecture Developing web applications with Django is very easy and fun: if you just follow the tutorial in a few hours you can have up and running your own website. However, deploying a Django site can be hard and you can end up running a site with a terrible performance if you don&amp;rsquo;t follow the recommended guidelines to deploy a Django site to a production environment.
There are many options to deploy a Django application but you will finish using a WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) which is a Python specification that describes how a webserver communicates with web applications.</description>

      <description>Hi,
My old site was a little bit abandoned and hard to update so I decided to renew it.
For this time, I decided to use a static site generator so I gave a chance to Hugo. I never tried before but I discovered that it has its own themes site which is awesome as saves you a lot of customization time. By the way, if you wonder what template I&amp;rsquo;m using is the Cocoa enhanced theme.</description>
